      <p>The Scan Session Tool is a graphical application for documenting (f)MRI scan sessions and automatized data archiving.
         Information about the scan session itself, used forms and documents, as well as the single measurements can be entered
         and saved into a protocol file. This information can furthermore beused to copy acquired data (DICOM images as well as
         optional stimulation protocols and logfiles into a specific hierarchical folder structure for unified archiving
         purposes, with optional sepcial support for <a href="https://brainvoyager.com/">(Turbo-)BrainVoyager</a>.</p>

<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>The Scan Session Tool is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> script and will hence run wherever Python (and <a href="http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/Tkinter">TKinter</a>, <a href="https://pyyaml.org/">PyYAML</a> and <a href="https://pydicom.github.io/">pydicom</a>) are installed.</p>

<p>
Install required packages with:
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install pyYAML pydicom</pre></code>
</p>

<p>Then simply run <code>python3 scan_session_tool.py</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>The user interface is organized into three different content areas, each hol-
ding different information about the scan session, as well as an additional
control area for opening and saving session information and for automatically
archiving acquired data, based on the session information.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-general-information-area" class="anchor" href="#the-general-information-area" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The "General Information" area</h3>

<p>This area provides input fields for basic information about the scan session.
Some of the fields allow for a selection of pre-specified values taken from a
config file (see below), while others take freely typed characters.
Fields that are marked with a red background, are mandatory and need to be
filled in. Fields that are marked with an orange background are automatically
filled in, but need to be checked.
The following fields are available:</p>

<pre><code>    "Project"        - The project identifier
                       (free-type and selection)

                       (free-type)
    "Time B"         - An additional time period (e.g. actual scanner usage)
                       (free-type)

                    (free-type)
    "Checklist"   - Checkboxes to specify which forms and documents have been

<h3>
<a id="the-measurements-area" class="anchor" href="#the-measurements-area" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The "Measurements" area</h3>

<p>This area provides several input fields for each measurement of the session.
When starting the application, only one (empty) measurement is shown. Click-
ing on "Add Measurement" will create additional measurements. Fields that are
marked with a red background, are mandatory and need to be filled in. Fields
that are marked with an orange background are automatically filled in, but
need to be checked.
The following input fields are available per measurement:</p>

<pre><code>    "No"                   - The number of the measurement
                             (001-999)
    "Type"                 - "anatomical", "functional" or "misc"
                             (selection)

                             (free-type, selection)
    "Logfiles"             - A newline separated list of all connected
                             logfiles; wildcard masks (*) will be completed
                             during archiving (please note that a stimulation
                             protocol mask will be included automatically,
                             based on the session information)
                             (free-type)
    "Comments"             - Any additional comments about the measurement
                             (free-type)
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="the-control-area" class="anchor" href="#the-control-area" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The control area</h3>

<p>The control area consists of the following three buttons:</p>

<pre><code>    "Open"    - Opens previously saved information from a text file
    "Save"    - Saves the entered session information into a text file
    "Archive" - Copies acquired data from a specified source folder into a
                target folder at another specified location. Please note that
                all data are expected to be within the specified source fol-
                der. That is, all DICOM files (*.dcm OR *.IMA; with or with-
                out sub-folders), all stimulation protocols and all logfiles.
                Optionally, links to the DICOM images in BrainVoyager and
                Turbo-BrainVoyager formats can be created. Turbo-BrainVoyager
                files and data will be manipulated to work in the target
                directory.
                The data will be copied into the following folder hierarchy:
                    DICOMs -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/<Type>/
                      <No>-<Name>/<DICOM>/
                    Logfiles -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/<Type>/
                      <No>-<Name>/
                    Files -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/
                    BrainVoyager files (links only, optional) -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/<BV>/
                    Turbo-BrainVoyager files (links only, optional) -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/<TBV>/
                    Scan Session Protocol -->
                      <Project>/sub-<Subject>/ses-<Session>/

</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="config-file" class="anchor" href="#config-file" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Config File</h2>

<p>A configuration file can be created to pre-define the values to be used as
selection options for the "Group", "Session", "Certified User", "Backup
Person", "Notes", the measurement "Name", "Vols" and "Comments" on a per
project basis, as well as additional items in the "Documents" section.
The Scan Session Tool will look for a configuration file with the name
"sst.yaml", located in the same directory as the application itself (does not
work for the OS X compiled .app) or in the $HOME folder.</p>

<p>The syntax is YAML. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>Project 1:
