{"name":"Scan Session Tool","tagline":"(f)MRI scan session documentation and data archiving","body":"The Scan Session Tool is a graphical application for documenting (f)MRI scan\r\nsessions and automatized data archiving. Information about the scan session\r\nitself, used forms and documents, as well as the single measurements can be\r\nentered and saved into a protocol file. This information can furthermore be\r\nused to copy acquired data (DICOM images, stimulation protocols, logfiles,\r\nTurbo Brain Voyager files) into a specific hierarchical folder structure for\r\nunified archiving purposes.\r\n\r\n![ScanSessionTool_Screenshot.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fladd/ScanSessionTool/gh-pages/ScanSessionTool_Screenshot.png \"Screenshot of Scan Session Tool\")\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\nThe Scan Session Tool is a [Python](http://www.python.org) script and will hence run wherever Python (and [TKinter](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/Tkinter)) are installed.\r\n\r\nIf Python cannot be installed, self-contained binary versions for Windows (.exe) and OS X (.app) are also available at the [release page](https://github.com/fladd/ScanSessionTool/releases/latest).\r\n\r\n#Documentation\r\n##Usage\r\nThe user interface is organized into three different content areas, each hol-\r\nding different information about the scan session, as well as an additional\r\ncontrol area for opening and saving session information and for automatically\r\narchiving acquired data, based on the session information.\r\n\r\n###The \"General Information\" area\r\nThis area provides input fields for basic information about the scan session.\r\nSome of the fields allow for a selection of pre-specified values taken from a\r\nconfig file (see below), while others take freely typed characters.\r\nFields that are marked with a red background, are mandatory and need to be\r\nfilled in. Fields that are marked with an orange background are automatically\r\nfilled in, but need to be checked.\r\nThe following fields are available:\r\n```\r\n    \"Project\"        - The project identifier\r\n                       (free-type and selection)\r\n    \"Group\"          - The group identifier\r\n                       (free-type and selection)\r\n    \"Subject No.\"    - The subject number\r\n                       (1-99)\r\n    \"Session\"        - The session identifier\r\n                       (free-type and selection)\r\n    \"Date\"           - The date of the scan session\r\n                       (free-type, auto-filled)\r\n    \"Booked Time\"    - The time period the scanner was booked\r\n                       (free-type)\r\n    \"Actual Time\"    - The time period the scanner was actually used\r\n                       (free-type)\r\n    \"Certified User\" - The responsible user\r\n                       (free-type and selection)\r\n    \"Backup Person\"  - An additional person\r\n                       (free-type and selection)\r\n    \"Notes\"          - Any additional notes about the session\r\n                       (free-type)\r\n```\r\n\r\n###The \"Documents\" area\r\nThis area provides checkboxes to specify which forms and documents have been\r\ncollected from the participant. Additional documents can be specified in a\r\nconfiguration file (see \"Config File\" section).\r\nThe following checkboxes are available:\r\n```\r\n    \"MR Safety Screening Form\"            - The (f)MRI screening from provi-\r\n                                            ded by the scanning institution\r\n    \"Participation Informed Consent Form\" - The official (f)MRI written con-\r\n                                            sent form\r\n```\r\n###The \"Measurements\" area\r\nThis area provides several input fields for each measurement of the session.\r\nWhen starting the application, only one (empty) measurement is shown. Click-\r\ning on \"Add Measurement\" will create additional measurements. Fields that are\r\nmarked with a red background, are mandatory and need to be filled in. Fields\r\nthat are marked with an orange background are automatically filled in, but\r\nneed to be checked.\r\nThe following input fields are available per measurement:\r\n```\r\n    \"No\"                   - The number of the measurement\r\n                             (1-99)\r\n    \"Type\"                 - \"anatomical\", \"functional\" or \"misc\"\r\n                             (selection)\r\n    \"Vols\"                 - The number of volumes of the measurement\r\n                             (free-type)\r\n    \"Name\"                 - The name of the measurement\r\n                             (free-type, selection)\r\n    \"Logfiles\"             - A newline separated list of all connected logfiles\r\n                             (free-type)\r\n                             (Please note that a stimulation protocol mask\r\n                             will be included automatically, based on the\r\n                             session information, and will be replaced by\r\n                             the found files matching this mask)\r\n    \"Comments\"             - Any additional comments about the measurement\r\n                             (free-type)\r\n```\r\n###The control area\r\nThe control area consists of the following three buttons:\r\n```\r\n\"Open\"    - Opens previously saved information from a text file\r\n\"Save\"    - Saves the entered session information into a text file\r\n\"Archive\" - Copies acquired data from specified location into a timestamped\r\n            sub-folder <~Archiveyyymmdd>. Please note that all data is\r\n            expected to be within the specified folder. That is, all DICOM\r\n            files (*.dcm OR *.IMA; no sub-folders!), all stimulation protocols,\r\n            all logfiles as well as all Turbo Brain Voyager files (all *.tbv\r\n            files in a folder called 'TBVFiles').\r\n            The data will be copied into the following folder hierarchy:\r\n            DICOMs -->\r\n              <Project>/<Subject[Group]>/<Session>/<Type>/<Name>/<DICOM>/\r\n            Logfiles -->\r\n              <Project>/<Subject[Group]>/<Session>/<Type>/<Name>/\r\n            Turbo Brain Voyager files -->\r\n             <Project>/<Subject[Group]>/<Session>/<Type>/<Name>/TBV/\r\n            Scan Session Protocol -->\r\n              <Project>/<Project>_<Subject[Group]>_Session_ScanProtocol.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Config File\r\nA configuration file can be created to pre-define the values to be used as\r\nselection options for the \"Group\", \"Session\", \"Certified User\", \"Backup\r\nPerson\", \"Notes\", the measurement \"Name\", \"Vols\" and \"Comments\" on a per\r\nproject basis, as well as additional items in the \"Documents\" section.\r\nThe Scan Session Tool will look for a configuration file with the name\r\n\"sst.yaml\", located in the same directory as the application itself (does not\r\nwork for the OS X compiled .app) or in the $HOME folder.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is YAML.
