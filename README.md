About
-----
The Scan Session Tool is a graphical application for documenting (f)MRI scan
sessions and automatized data archiving. Information about the scan session
itself, used forms and documents, as well as the single measurements can be
entered and saved into a protocol file. This information can furthermore be
used to copy acquired data (DICOM images, stimulation protocols, logfiles,
Turbo Brain Voyager files) into a specific hierarchical folder structure for
unified archiving purposes.

Download
--------
The Scan Session Tool is a Python script and hence runs wherever Python and
TKinter are installed.

Binay versions can be downloaded from [the release page](https://github.com/fladd/ScanSessionTool/releases/latest).


Documentation
-------------
The full documentation can be found from within the programme, by clicking on
the "?" button, or by selecting "Scan Session Tool Help" from the Help menu.
